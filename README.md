# Gitsidian theme
A basic theme for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), that (for now) only changes your preview mode to look more like GitHub markdown styles

## Expectations:
- This was hacked up in a couple hours
- It only affects your preview mode right now, the rest of the app will look like the default obsidian
- I am not death_au

## Installation
Just download the obsidian.css file and drop it into your vault. Make sure custom themes are turned on

#### Alternatively:
- If you want to keep your existing theme but use this for preview, and want to be a little hacky, you should be able to copy and paste all of the contents of this obsidian.css into the end of yours existing one, and it might just work, since it should only affect your preview mode.

## In the future
- When I have time I plan on making a dark version of preview (GitHub doesnt have an official dark version)
- Also plan to fork this into two different projects:
	1. A proper css add-on version that can be pasted to the end of any theme in order so that it only affects preview
	2. A full theme that properly responds to dark/light mode and some "github" inspired interface stylings
