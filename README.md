# Gitsidian theme
A basic theme for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), that **only changes your preview mode** to look more like GitHub markdown styles. Maybe more in the future.

## Fair warning:
- I am not death_au

## Installation
Just download the obsidian.css file and drop it into your vault. Make sure custom themes are turned on

#### Alternatively:
- If you want to keep your existing theme but use this for preview, and want to be a little hacky, you should be able to copy and paste all of the contents of this obsidian.css into the end of yours existing one, and it might just work, since it should only affect your preview mode.

## In the future:
- Plan to split this into two different versions:
	1. A version that can properly be pasted to the end of any theme so that it overrides and only affects preview
	2. A full theme that properly responds to dark/light mode and some "github inspired" interface stylings
